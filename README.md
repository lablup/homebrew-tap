### Alternative Installation (without tap)

```bash
# Install directly using the full formula path
brew install lablup/tap/all-smi
brew install lablup/tap/bssh
```

## Usage Examples

### all-smi

```bash
# Display GPU information
all-smi

# Show version information
all-smi --version

# Continuous monitoring (if supported)
all-smi --loop
```

### bssh

```bash
# Execute a command on multiple hosts
bssh -h host1,host2,host3 "uptime"

# Run commands from a hosts file
bssh -f hosts.txt "df -h"

# Execute with custom SSH options
bssh -h server1,server2 -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" "ls -la"

# Show version
bssh --version
```
